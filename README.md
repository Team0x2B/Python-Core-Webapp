# About
We wanted to make an app that allows people to easily find other people to study with. We knew that we wanted it to be location based and have the main interface be a map. We also knew that we would need to let the user search and filter the results by subject. The final application is a web app that allows users to create a study "group". They set the location of this group, say what subject they are studying, and add a description. When the group is created, all other users can see this group and can either join the group if they want to study with them, or make a new group if they want to study something different.

# How to use Studi
To use the app, go to https://studi-demo.herokuapp.com/
Once there, the UI is very intuitive. You can click on any of the pins to see what and where people are studying. If you want to sign in, click the menu in the corner and choose "Login or Create Account". Once signed in, you can see what group you are currently studying with by clicking on "My Gropup", or you can create a new study group by clicking on "Create Group".
